# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.3] — 2025-01-09

### Added

- **Mockfish Development Mode**: Added `MOCKFISH` environment variable to enable development and testing without physical hardware. When enabled, GPIO operations and button presses are mocked, allowing full testing of Billy's functionality on any machine without a Raspberry Pi or physical Billy Bass. (contribution by: @turekaj)

### Fixed

- **Version Detection**: Fixed issue where the updater would show an incorrect version (e.g., v2.0.1) even when a newer tag (e.g., v2.0.2) was checked out. Improved version detection logic now properly handles detached HEAD state and uses multiple fallback methods (`git tag --points-at HEAD`, `git describe --tags --exact-match`, `git describe --tags`) to accurately detect the current checked-out version.
- **Logging Integration**: Version detection and update processes now use the centralized logging system, respecting the `LOG_LEVEL` setting for appropriate verbosity.

---

## [2.0.2] — 2025-12-25

### Fixed

- **Song Interruption**: Fixed critical bug where interrupting a song (especially after multiple times) would cause the session to hang indefinitely. Button presses after interruption would have no effect. The fix adds proper interrupt checking in the song playback loop and uses a timeout-based approach instead of blocking indefinitely.
- **Documentation**: Added missing `liblgpio-dev` and `liblgpio1` system dependencies to installation instructions. These packages are required for the `lgpio` Python package to build successfully.

---

## [2.0.1] — 2025-12-07

### Fixed

- **MQTT Session Hanging**: Fixed issue where MQTT announcements without follow-up (e.g., "The washing machine is finished") would leave the session open indefinitely until hitting OpenAI's 60-minute timeout limit. Sessions now properly close when no follow-up is needed.

## [2.0.0] — 2025-11-02
>### 🎉 Major New Features:
> User Profiles with memories - Multiple Personas - Custom Song Manager - Mqtt Say command support for follow-ups 

>### ⚠️ For existing builds of Billy
>
> **If you're coming from <= v1.4.0:** Please select the Legacy Pin Layout in the Hardware Settings tab of the Web UI if you can't switch to the new unified wiring layout (see [BUILDME.md](./docs/BUILDME.md#from-motor-driver-to-raspberry-pi-gpio-pinout))

### Added

- **User Profiles**: Billy now identifies users when they introduce themselves (e.g., "Hi Billy, it's Thom")
  - Create/switch profiles, set display names, guest mode
  - Import/export profiles
  - Profile-specific statistics like interaction count and last seen timestamps
- **Memory System**: Billy remembers facts, preferences, and relationships for each user
  - Categorize by type (fact, preference, relationship, event, other)
  - Set importance levels (low, medium, high)
  - Edit/delete memories through UI
- **Multiple Personas**: Create and switch between different Billy personalities
  - Voices and mouth articulation per persona
  - Configurable personality traits (humor, sarcasm, honesty, etc.)
  - Import/export personas
  - Mid-conversation persona switching with graceful voice changes
  - Persona presets/templates for quick setup
- **Custom Song Manager**: Web UI for managing custom songs
  - Upload custom audio files (full.wav, vocals.wav, drums.wav)
  - Configure playback & animation settings (gain, tail threshold, compensate tail, head moves, half tempo tail flap)
  - Set song title and keywords for AI-triggered playback
  - Preview audio files before saving
  - Copy example songs to get started
- **UI Improvements**: 
  - 4-level configurable logging (ERROR/WARNING/INFO/VERBOSE)
  - Loading states and optimized polling

### Changed

- **Persona Storage**: Personas now stored in `./personas/persona_name/persona.ini`. The default persona remains at `./persona.ini` for backward compatibility.
- **Custom Wake-up Sounds**: Wake-up sounds are now saved per persona instead of globally
- **Logging System**: Replaced `DEBUG_MODE` with configurable `LOG_LEVEL` system (ERROR/WARNING/INFO/VERBOSE)
- **Mouth Articulation**: Now configured per persona instead of globally
- **Song Metadata Format**: Updated from `metadata.txt` to `metadata.ini` for consistency
- **Song Directory**: Custom songs now stored in `custom_songs/` (git-ignored) instead of `sounds/songs/` (which still holds the fishsticks song as a template)
- **MQTT Follow-up Handling**: MQTT prompts now respect `follow_up_intent` - if Billy asks a question via MQTT (e.g., "What's your favorite color?"), the mic stays open for your response in `auto` mode

### Fixed

- **Self-Triggering**: Billy no longer hears his own wake-up sounds
- **Head Movement**: Prevented head from getting stuck during routines
- **Session Hanging**: Added timeouts to prevent stuck sessions
- **Audio**: Standardized RMS calculations for consistent silence detection
- **Function Call Flow**: Fixed "conversation already has an active response" error by properly closing function calls with `function_call_output` before OpenAI auto-generates responses
- **GPIO Cleanup**: Fixed "double free or corruption" crash on shutdown by properly closing GPIO resources
- **Smart Home Commands**: Billy now correctly distinguishes between direct commands ("turn on lights") and questions ("ask if lights should be on") - no longer executes commands when asked to ask first
- **Function Confirmations**: Fixed issue where Billy wouldn't always provide spoken confirmation after smart home commands and personality changes - now reliably triggers verbal responses

## [1.5.0] — 2025-10-13

>### ⚠️ For existing builds of Billy: ⚠️ 
> 
> **Please select the Legacy Pin Layout in the Hardware Settings tab of the Web UI if you can't switch to the new unified wiring layout (see [BUILDME.md](./docs/BUILDME.md#from-motor-driver-to-raspberry-pi-gpio-pinout))**

### Added
- **Configurable Pin Layouts:** Introduced `BILLY_PINS` Pin Layout setting (`new` / `legacy`) to switch between the new (default) pin layout and the legacy pin layout (for builds before october '25)
- **Mouth Articulation Control:** Added `MOUTH_ARTICULATION` (1–10) setting to fine-tune speech motion responsiveness.
- **Error Sound Handling:**  Centralized error playback — now plays `error.wav`, `noapikey.wav`, or `nowifi.wav` depending on the issue.
- **Release notes notification:** Notification in the UI with the release notes of the latest version.

### Changed
- **Unified GPIO Logic:** Refactored motor control for both Modern (2-motor) and Classic (3-motor) models into a single system. Default pin assignments moved to safer GPIOs. Unused H-bridge inputs are now grounded;
- **Movement Refinements:** Improved PWM handling and non-blocking motion timing for smoother, more natural flapping.
- **UI Enhancements:** Added Billy artwork to header and included reboot/power/restart-ui buttons. Improved feedback for mic and speaker device tests.

### Fixed
- Minor mouth sync inconsistencies under load.
- Occasional stalls caused by blocking PWM threads.
- Better recovery after OpenAI API or network errors.
- Motor watchdog will now disengage any motor that is on > 30 seconds

### Added

- **'Dory' Mode**: Optional single-response mode where Billy answers only once before ending the session. (requested by @kenway33 )
